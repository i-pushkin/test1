## Check requirements

Before starting system configuration, it is recommended to run the host readiness check scripts.

### Docker All-In-One

Navigate to the checkers directory and run the pre-checker-all.sh script. The script must be run with sudo.
```bash
sudo ./pre-checker-all.sh
```

### Docker Separated

To check the bio host, navigate to the checkers directory on the respective host and run the pre-checker-bio.sh script.

```bash
./pre-checker-bio.sh
```

To check the api host, navigate to the checkers directory on the respective host and run the pre-checker-api.sh script.

```bash
./pre-checker-api.sh
```

## Usage

### Docker All-In-One

This configuration involves running all services on a single host.

```commandline
docker compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-all.yml up -d
```

### Docker Separated

This configuration involves running the tfss service and the api service on different hosts.

TFSS host

```commandline
docker compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-bio.yml up -d
```

API host

```commandline
docker compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-api.yml up -d
```

### Podman

```commandline
podman-compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-separated.yml up -d
```

## Monitoring

Access the metrics using the following paths:

| Service  | Path                         |
|----------|------------------------------|
| TFSS     | :8501/metrics/tfss           |
| Celery   | :5555/metrics/flower/metrics |
| Redis    | :9117/metrics/redis          |
| Postgres | :9187/metrics                |
| Nginx    | :9113/metrics/nginx          |

## Stop services

### Docker

```commandline
docker compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-separated.yml down
```

### Podman

```commandline
podman-compose --env-file configs/config.env -f docker-compose-separated.yml down
```

## Hints:
  * All DBs are precreated with init-* containers. To recreate DB, delete db folders in data\postgres & pg-o2n folders. Refer to configs section for configs reference.
  * To enable TFSS, uncomment oz-tfss section in docker-compose.yaml, lines 323-338. To use external TFSS change configs\api\config.py. Must have license and models in place for operations. Refer to configs section for configs and data reference.
  * To use TFSS server balancing, use service bioloadbalancer in docker-compose-bio.yaml and the nginx configuration example configs\nginx\bioloadbalancer.conf. Default service is not used.
